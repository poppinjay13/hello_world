# hello_world
My first git project
I guess I'm just trynna learn  how to properly set up and use git repositories for future reference.
On second thought. Let's make it interesting.
The name's Ian.
Not perfect I know but my parents were undercompensating for ... yeah.
Poppinjay13 was a school nickname, coz no one could think of abetter one to describe me.
Hobbies include drawing, writing, singing, reading, gaming, hiking, irritating, looking like a snack, eating snacks-or eating in general-, listening, being all-round romantic, being egotistical. 
I feel it necessary to mention that I don't exactly excel at these hobbies, I just do them well enough to warrant a mention, hence the inclusion in the list. I also feel it necessary to mention that I've had no complaints from the ladies. Yet.
So yeah, that's what you're dealing with.
Hello World ?
No ?
